# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-Spotify-playlist-recommedation

Effective communication is essential for social connection, and emotions play a vital role in this process. 
As humans, we primarily use speech and language to communicate with each other, and the way we express our emotions through speech can vary depending on the intensity and type of emotion we are experiencing. 
Recognizing emotions in speech is a challenging but essential task in human-machine interaction. Our project aims to create an intelligent system that can recognize emotions in speech using a convolutional neural network (MLP classifier) and recommend a Spotify playlist based on the identified emotion. This system will utilize various modules for emotion recognition, classifier training, and integration with the Spotify API.
